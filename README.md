Completed a Java course focused on object list handling. Learned to use ArrayList, sort with Comparator/Comparable, perform casting, and use instanceof. Gained solid skills in object-oriented programming and data structures. Instructor: Jacqueline Oliveira – Alura Latam.

Course – Completed

During the course, I developed essential skills for working with object lists in Java, including:

Efficient and organized representation of object lists in Java.

In-depth understanding of the ArrayList class, its methods, and practical applications.

Object list manipulation through adding, removing, and iterating elements.

Sorting lists based on specific criteria using Comparator and Comparable.

Applying casting techniques and using the instanceof operator for type checking.

This knowledge provided me with a strong foundation in working with data structures and writing clean, safe, and object-oriented Java code.
